## Assumptions
- There wont be many maintainers per package
- A Package is a set of defined sources and build instructions that together can be built into a binary software that can be redistributed with either IPS or as a Tarball
- SVR4 may be important later
## Desicions
- Not much can be decided now as most questions need to be handled by the tools when they come up and when we start supporting that domain specific feature.
- Domain specific details can be known and understood by the forge since this is it's main purpose.
