# SolARM Gate
This Repository contains the sources for all the Tools needed to build the SolARM distribution.
To build the distribution use the build packages from the namespace "developer/distribution"

## Design Goals
- Seperate source code from build space (Workspace)
- interactive change of defintions
- linting of defintions
- be able to step through the whole proces step by step
- define a update workflow and guide the user through it
- be able to view failed steps
- force subtools to use the right diagnostic output places
